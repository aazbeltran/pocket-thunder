# PocketThunder

A kid's AI vibe-coding playground: playful, messy, learning-first experiments made for fun.

Not production. Not stable. Not serious. Just curiosity and tiny bursts of "wow."

## Projects

| Project | Description | Play |
|---------|-------------|------|
| [Conecta Caos](conecta-caos/) | Chaotic Connect 4 with wild mods | [Play](https://aazbeltran.github.io/pocket-thunder/conecta-caos/) |

## What is This?

PocketThunder is a collection of small, playful experiments built with AI assistance. Each project lives in its own folder with its own README.

**Philosophy:**
- Learning over polish
- Fun over features
- Experiments over enterprise
- Vibes over velocity

## Quick Start

Each project is self-contained. Navigate to a project folder and follow its README.

```bash
# Example: Run Conecta Caos locally
cd conecta-caos
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```
